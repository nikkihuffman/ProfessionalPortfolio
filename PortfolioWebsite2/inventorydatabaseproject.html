						<h1>Inventory Management Database</h1>
					</header>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/warehouse.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>I created a database for inventory and warehouse management for a company that
						manufactures semi-custom accessories for kitchen appliances. They produced about 350 unique
						designs that were
						compatible with a variety of different stove range and cooktop model numbers. Each design was
						available in either Lite or Premium material, and Black or Silver color. All four
						of these variations (Lite Black, Lite Silver, Premium Black and Premium Silver) needed to be
						kept in stock. A few designs were also offered in Copper Lite and Gold Lite, but since they were
						less popular, those variations were made to order. There were two main
						ways
						the products were manufactured, either one at a time on a Zund (CNC) machine, or several at a
						time with a die board using a clicker press.

					</p>
					<p>We were having trouble finding a software that would work for us out of the box,
						primarily because our SKU to product ratio was not one-to-one. For example, let's say product
						number 100 was compatible with four different stove models: AAA, BBB, CCC and DDD. In our
						Shopify store we could list a SKU for a 1-pack and 3-pack of each material and color for product
						100.
						But on Amazon we would need to include the model number within the SKU becuase of the
						constraints of their system. So the 100 Lite Black product alone would have the following SKUs
						coming from that one stock level (these are not the actual SKUs but simplified for demonstration
						purposes):

					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>100-LT-BLK (Shopify 1-pack)</li>
						<li>100-LT-BLK-3X (Shopify 3-pack)</li>
						<li>100-LT-BLK-AAA (Amazon 1-pack for model AAA)</li>
						<li>100-LT-BLK-BBB (Amazon 1-pack for model BBB)</li>
						<li>100-LT-BLK-CCC (Amazon 1-pack for model CCC)</li>
						<li>100-LT-BLK-DDD (Amazon 1-pack for model DDD)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Most of the warehouse management softwares I looked into were set up to simply keep track of a
						SKU coming from a specific location in the warehouse in a one-to-one ratio. We needed a database
						that would be able to group together all the SKUs that were coming from the same stock shelf.

					</p>
					<p>The database would need to be able to keep track of current stock levels of both raw/uncut
						materials,
						plus the finished/cut products that were on the shelves. Each finished product would need
						minimum stock and restock numbers so that workers would know <b>when</b> the product stock
						needed
						replenished, and <b>how much</b> to cut of each one. The database should include bin locations
						for each product both for the purpose of restocking the shelves and for picking current orders.
						Additionally we should be able to keep track of waste in the production process, as well as what
						packaging was used to keep track of our box stock levels.
					</p>

					<h3>Workflow</h3>
					<p>An order comes in through one of the online stores and updates
						the orders and order_items tables. The current stock levels in the products table are
						diminished by the correct amount based on the SKUs in order_items. A pick_list view is generated
						for unfulfilled orders, and warehouse workers use that list to pick and pack. In the
						meantime, as product stock levels decrease below their minimum_stock_alert number, they are
						included
						in a cut_list view for the members of the production team. They cut the amount stated and update
						the production table with the appropriate information. The scan_sku for each
						product is the basic Shopify 1-pack SKU, which needs mapped onto the correct product and added
						to its stock levels. At the same time the raw_materials table needs the stock diminished for the
						raw materials used in production.

					<h2 id="content">Views</h2>
					<h3>Pick List View</h3>
					<p>This is the pick list for the entire list of unfulfilled order items, excluding warranties and
						other intangible products, and sorted by bin location to ensure efficient picking.</p>
					<pre><code>
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW pick_list AS
SELECT
	p.product_name,
	(SELECT bin_location FROM products WHERE p.product_name = product_name) AS bin_location,
	SUM(oi.quantity * s.quantity_per_pack) AS quantity_to_pick
FROM order_items oi
JOIN skus s USING (sku)
JOIN products p USING (product_id)
WHERE order_item_status = 'pending' AND sku NOT LIKE '%warranty' AND sku NOT LIKE 'SS%'
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY bin_location	
</code></pre>

					<h3>Cut List View</h3>
					<p>The cut list is sorted both by what machine is used in production and what type and color of
						raw material is needed. If a stock level dips below zero, the cut amount should include the
						standard restock
						level for that product, plus however much it has gone below zero. This ensures that the cut_now
						amount will cover all current orders plus the standard stock level.</p>
					<pre><code>
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW cut_list AS
SELECT 
	p.product_name,
	p.bin_location,
	(CASE
		WHEN (p.stock < 0) THEN (p.restock_amount - p.stock)
		ELSE p.restock_amount
	END) AS cut_now,
	p.mfg_method,
	rm.size,
	rm.material_type,
	rm.color,
	p.stock
FROM products p
JOIN raw_materials rm 
	USING (raw_material_id)
WHERE
	p.stock <= p.minimum_stock_alert
	AND p.mfg_method IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY p.mfg_method , rm.material_type , rm.color;
</code></pre>
					<h3>Box Report</h3>
					<p>Packaging has been given a priority number based on how large it is. The largest box is Priority
						1, the next largest Priority 2 and so on. When multiple items are ordered, the packaging chosen
						must accommodate the largest item in the order. The box report has been designed to concatenate
						all order items and boxes needed for an order, and list the highest priority box first.</p>
					<pre><code>
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW box_report AS
SELECT
	oi.order_number,
	group_concat(p.product_name ORDER BY p.product_name) AS items,
	group_concat((SELECT name FROM packaging WHERE packaging_id =p.packaging_id) 
			ORDER BY (SELECT priority FROM packaging WHERE packaging_id = p.packaging_id)) AS boxes
FROM order_items oi
JOIN skus s USING (sku)
JOIN products p USING (product_id)
WHERE p.packaging_id != 7
GROUP BY order_number
ORDER BY boxes
</code></pre>
					<h2 id="content">Refining the Pick List Process</h2>
					<p>The picking/packing team don't normally pick the entire list of unfulfilled orders all in one go.
						They'll split the list up into groups of about 30 orders each based on common items, then print
						out the shipping labels associated with the orders just picked. The process
						is a bit slow and tedious, so I wanted to find a way to streamline it and let the database
						handle grouping together similar order items and creating subsets of the entire pick list
						accordingly.
					</p>
					<h3>Concatenated Pick List</h3>
					<p>The concatenated pick list is designed to sort pending orders based on included items and then
						limit
						it to the first 30 orders.
					</p>
					<pre><code>
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW concat_pick_list AS
SELECT
	o.date_ordered,
	oi.order_number,
	group_concat(p.product_name ORDER BY p.product_name) AS items,
	group_concat(p.bin_location ORDER BY p.bin_location) AS bins
FROM order_items oi
JOIN skus s USING (sku)
JOIN products p USING (product_id)
JOIN orders o USING (order_number)
WHERE order_item_status = 'pending' AND sku NOT LIKE '%warranty' AND sku NOT LIKE 'SS%'
GROUP BY order_number
ORDER BY bins
LIMIT 0,30
						</code></pre>
					<h3>Subset Pick List</h3>
					<p>The subset pick list is exactly the same as the original pick list for all unfulfilled orders,
						but now includes the exact 30
						orders listed in the concatenated pick list.</p>
					<pre><code>
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW subset_pick_list AS
SELECT p.product_name, 
	(SELECT bin_location FROM products WHERE p.product_name = product_name) AS bin_location,
	SUM(oi.quantity * s.quantity_per_pack) AS quantity_to_pick
FROM order_items oi
JOIN skus s USING (sku)
JOIN products p USING (product_id)
WHERE order_number IN (SELECT order_number FROM concat_pick_list)
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY bin_location
													</code></pre>
					<h2 id="content">Next Steps</h2>
					<p>Now that the database is working smoothly within MySQL, our next steps would be to set up an API
						connection to the marketplaces and our shipping software so that the orders and order_items
						tables get live updates.
						Additionally, it would be beneficial to set up a simple user interface for
						the workers in the warehouse to be able to access the views and update the production table.
