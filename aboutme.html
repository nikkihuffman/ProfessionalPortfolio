					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/headshot.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Born and raised in
						northeastern Ohio, I graduated from Baldwin-Wallace University in 2008 with my BS in Mathematics
						and high school teaching license. After graduation I taught and tutored math in a few local
						school districts. I loved breaking down complex concepts and explaining them with students
						one-on-one and in small groups. Unfortunately, that only constitutes a small portion of the job
						of a teacher, and after about four years I was burned out and ready for change. (Side note,
						let's show some support and appreciation to the teachers out there in the trenches every day.
						They need it.)
					</p>
					<p>In 2013 I began to look into other fields where I could work with my degree, and statistical
						analysis came up quite often. However, at the time the field seemed to be narrowly defined and
						difficult to get into. I took two graduate level classes in Statistics, but I wasn't finding
						much work available. I decided to go back to math teaching, but this time in an online setting.
					</p>
					<p>A few years later an
						acquaintance approached me asking if I'd have time to help him do some manual website scraping
						for the startup business he was running out of his garage. It sounded interesting, so
						I agreed. Soon after I started, the company's main eCommerce manager quit, and I fell into the
						role. Eventually the business grew to the point where I was able to quit teaching and work for
						them exclusively. Five years and about a thousand Excel spreadsheets later, I had gained a
						pretty
						thorough knowledge of online marketplaces, research and development, product databases, running
						sales reports, and basically anything else the bosses wanted me to do on a daily basis. I was
						there every
						step of the way as the company grew from a handful of people in a one-car garage to employing
						over 20 employees out of a 50,000 square foot warehouse.</p>
					<p>In 2023 I started looking into the field of data analytics again, and wow had things changed in
						ten years. Data analysis has exploded, and the types of positions available span basically every
						industry out there. I excitedly dove in to the process of building on the skills I had gained in
						my
						eCommerce position, and I haven't looked back since! I absolutely love getting my head down into
						seemingly meaningless data and making sense out of it.
